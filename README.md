# Extended-ACL
An access control list is a set of rules allowing or blocking traffic within a network, providing basic security. An extended access list is more flexible and customizable than a standard access control list. An ACL can tell a computer operating system what users have access rights to specific system objects, such as individual files or directories. An extended ACL can serve as an extension of a standard ACL with more specific parameters. This can increase network security while prioritizing the flow of traffic within a network. Network security needs to constantly evolve as the world changes and threats evolve. It is even more important to restrict access to potential bad actors while still allowing necessary traffic through uninhibited for a smooth customer and employee interface and digital interaction.
